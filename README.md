# Announcing Signal Drive Communicator
Effortless driver-to-driver communication - no typing required

# What is Signal?
Finally, you can communicate clearly with the vehicle in the next lane. No need to sign up. Just press the voice button and say your message. Signal understands messages like “headlights on for safety”, “your vehicle is leaking”, and many more! You can even post a local alert like "pothole" or "animal on the road" 🐕

# Motivation
Signal is about contributing to a friendly and safe journey for everyone. The app itself satisfies that responsibility through thoughtful design that respects human strengths and weaknesses. Join in by using the Signal to send helpful messages and local alerts. It’s never been easier to help your fellow motorists and your community.
